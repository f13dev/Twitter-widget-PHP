Twitter widget PHP
===============

Add a twitter widget to your website to show a snapshot of your profile and your latest tweets.

This widget utilises code from the [J7mbo/twitter-api-php](https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php) repository.

How to use
----------

Within your website code, add your chosen HTML container tag, referencing twitter.php?user=$1&count=$2&target_blank

Replace $1 with your twitter username and $2 with the number of tweets to display. The last attribute, 'target_blank', is optional depending on whether your would prefer links to open in the current tab or a new tab.
